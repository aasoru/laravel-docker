Laravel + React with Docker

## First of all - Docker
To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/) on your system, and then clone this repository.

Next, navigate in your terminal to the directory you cloned this, and spin up the containers for the web server by running `docker-compose up -d --build site`.

Make sure you have the `src` folder created, it can be empty, or it can contains yout own Laravel Project.

Bringing up the Docker Compose network with `site` instead of just using `up`, ensures that only our site's containers are brought up at the start, instead of all of the command containers as well. The following are built for our web server, with their exposed ports detailed:

- **nginx** - `:80`
- **mysql** - `:3306`
- **php** - `:9000`
- **redis** - `:6379`
- **mailhog** - `:8025` 

Three additional containers are included that handle Composer, NPM, and Artisan commands *without* having to have these platforms installed on your local computer. Use the following command examples from your project root, modifying them to fit your particular use case.

- `docker-compose run --rm composer update`
- `docker-compose run --rm npm run dev`
- `docker-compose run --rm artisan migrate`

##Â Once Docker is Ok - Laravel Set Up
If you want to use this Laravel 8 project just go to `src` folder

```bash
cd src 
```

#### Create your environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

_The app key is used to salt passwords. If you need to work with production data you'll want to use the same app key as defined in the .env file in production so password hashes match._

#### Update these settings in the .env file:

-   DB_DATABASE (your local database, i.e. "todo")
-   DB_USERNAME (your local db username, i.e. "root")
-   DB_PASSWORD (your local db password, i.e. "")
-   HASHIDS_SALT (use the app key or match the variable used in production)

#### Install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

_If you don't have Composer installed, [instructions here](https://getcomposer.org/)._

#### Generate an app key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

#### Generate JWT keys for the .env file:

```bash
php artisan jwt:secret
```

#### Run the database migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

#### Install Javascript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

_If you don't have Node and NPM installed, [instructions here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)._

#### Run an initial build:

```bash
npm run development
```

### Additional Set Up Tips

#### Database Seeding

If you need sample data to work with, you can seed the database:

```
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed --force
```

#### Seeded User

After seeding the database, you can log in with these credentials:

Email: `user@test.dev`
Password: `password`


## Permissions Issues

If you encounter any issues with filesystem permissions while visiting your application or running a container command, try completing one of the sets of steps below.

**If you are using your server or local environment as the root user:**

- Bring any container(s) down with `docker-compose down`
- Rename `docker-compose.root.yml` file to `docker-compose.root.yml`, replacing the previous one
- Re-build the containers by running `docker-compose build --no-cache`

**If you are using your server or local environment as a user that is not root:**

- Bring any container(s) down with `docker-compose down`
- In your terminal, run `export UID=$(id -u)` and then `export GID=$(id -g)`
- If you see any errors about readonly variables from the above step, you can ignore them and continue
- Re-build the containers by running `docker-compose build --no-cache`

Then, either bring back up your container network or re-run the command you were trying before, and see if that fixes it.

## Persistent MySQL Storage

By default, whenever you bring down the Docker network, your MySQL data will be removed after the containers are destroyed. If you would like to have persistent data that remains after bringing containers down and back up, do the following:

1. Create a `mysql` folder in the project root, alongside the `nginx` and `src` folders.
2. Under the mysql service in your `docker-compose.yml` file, add the following lines:

```
volumes:
  - ./mysql:/var/lib/mysql
```

## Using BrowserSync with Laravel Mix

If you want to enable the hot-reloading that comes with Laravel Mix's BrowserSync option, you'll have to follow a few small steps. First, ensure that you're using the updated `docker-compose.yml` with the `:3000` and `:3001` ports open on the npm service. Then, add the following to the end of your Laravel project's `webpack.mix.js` file:

```javascript
.browserSync({
    proxy: 'site',
    open: false,
    port: 3000,
});
```

From your terminal window at the project root, run the following command to start watching for changes with the npm container and its mapped ports:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports npm run watch
```

That should keep a small info pane open in your terminal (which you can exit with Ctrl + C). Visiting [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser should then load up your Laravel application with BrowserSync enabled and hot-reloading active.

## MailHog

The current version of Laravel (8 as of today) uses MailHog as the default application for testing email sending and general SMTP work during local development. Using the provided Docker Hub image, getting an instance set up and ready is simple and straight-forward. The service is included in the `docker-compose.yml` file, and spins up alongside the webserver and database services.

To see the dashboard and view any emails coming through the system, visit [localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) after running `docker-compose up -d site`.
